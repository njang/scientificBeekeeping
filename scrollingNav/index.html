            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p class="lead">This is not a "How You Should Keep Bees" site; rather, I'm a proponent of "Whatever Works for You" beekeeping. I'm a "data over dogma" guy, and I implore my readers to correct me on any information at this website that is out of date or not supported by evidence.</p>

            <p>I've visited beekeepers in many countries, and realize that there are as many ways to keep bees as there are beekeepers. The bees don't care whether you are a commercial or hobby beekeeper, nor whether your personal preference is Langstroth, Warre, top-bar, small cell, foundationless, "natural" or conventional beekeeping – <em><strong>the same biology applies to all</strong></em>.  My goal is to provide any and all beekeepers with a resource of readable and straightforward information on how to practice good bee husbandry, and to exercise environmental and community responsibility.</p>

            <p>This site is more or less a record of my learning process as I apply my formal training as a biologist to the practice of running my ever-evolving commercial beekeeping operation in California. I have no interest in offering advice (there are plenty of beekeepers more than eager to do that). Rather, what I do offer is <strong><em>evidence-based</em></strong> and <em><strong>scientifically-verified</strong></em> explanations of the biological processes occurring in the hive, as well as the effects of various management options. I then leave it to each beekeeper to use that information in order to make their own <em><strong>better-informed practical management decisions.  </strong></em></p>

            <p>In this "post-truth, information overload era" novice beekeepers can be overwhelmed by an internet and popular press chock full of conflicting strong opinions and questionable advice. If you are a beginning beekeeper looking for basic information, or an experienced beekeeper looking for a summary of mite treatment options, I suggest that you go directly to <a title="Basic Beekeeping" href="http://scientificbeekeeping.com/first-year-care-for-your-nuc/">Basic Beekeeping</a>. Otherwise, I suggest that you click on the blue categories to the right of each page to see which articles are available, or go to <em>Articles By Publication Date</em>, or use the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> function at the top of each page to look for topics.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My Background</strong></p>

            <p>I started keeping bees as a hobbyist around 1966, and then went on to get university degrees in biological sciences, specializing in entomology. In 1980 I began to build a migratory beekeeping operation in California, and currently run around 1000-1500 hives with my two sons, from which we make our livings (update: Eric and Ian are in the process of taking over the operation&#8211;allowing me more time for research).</p>

            <p>In 1993, the varroa mite arrived in California, and after it wiped out my operation for the second time in 1999, I decided to &#8220;hit the books&#8221; and use my scientific background to learn to fight back. I started writing for the American Bee Journal in 2006, and have submitted articles nearly every month since then (see &#8220;Articles by Publication Date&#8221;).</p>

            <p>My writing for the Journal brought me requests to speak at beekeeping conventions, which has also allowed me the chance to visit beekeepers from all over North America and several other continents. I read most every scientific study relating to beekeeping, and regularly correspond with beekeepers and researchers worldwide.</p>

            <p>What I try to do in my articles and blogs is to scour scientific papers for practical beekeeping applications, and to sort through the advice, opinion, and conjecture found in the bee magazines and on the Web, taking no positions other than to provide accurate information to Joe Beekeeper.</p>

            <p>I regularly update the articles on this site as new information becomes available, and solicit constructive criticism or comments. Perhaps the best venue for such discussion is at the <a href="http://community.lsoft.com/scripts/wa-LSOFTDONATIONS.exe?A0=BEE-L">Informed Discussion of Beekeeping Issues and Bee Biology</a>. Be sure to subscribe to updates, and I&#8217;ll email you monthly when I add content to the site <a title="Subscribe to updates" href="http://scientificbeekeeping.com/scientific-beekeeping-newsletter/">http://scientificbeekeeping.com/scientific-beekeeping-newsletter/<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br />
